## My Code Challenges

The purpose of this repo was to learn about shell scripting, executing challenges, and finding ways to write legible commands. 

While it's not required, it is helpful to know shell scripts. This will give us a step up once we reach the point of looking for a career in the cyber security field. It's important to understand how shell scripts work and how they can benefit you in the future. 

I learned a lot of interesting fundimental concepts in Ops 201, inlcuding Bash, Powershell, Functions, Arrays.

If I had to pick a favorite Ops Challenge assignment, it'd probably be class 04, or class 13. I grasped information the best in these specific assignments and found them fun and interesting to write. 

Thses are examples of how shell scripting can be applied to a workplace:
Automating tasks - Create user accounts, install software, update security.
Processing data - Sort data, convert formats, extract information.
Streamlining workflows - Automate repetitive command-line tasks.
Monitoring systems -Track resource usage, generate reports.
Managing configurations - Ensure consistent system setups.

I think all scripts could use some improvement, I don't believe in anything being perfect all the time. 
My hope is to understanding more about how bash and powershell differ from each other.
